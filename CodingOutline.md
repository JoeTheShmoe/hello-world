### Main
#### Shape of coeff matrix

#### Linear model:
Get Coefficients

#### Linear model (LASSO):
Talk about Coeff

#### Decision tree

* TestTrainSplit 
    - and show what the results are
* fit
* predict 
    - Show predictions
* feature importances 
    - Discuss potential pitfalls
* Cross Validation 
    - show simple, show split

A similar thing maybe should be done with a random forest (and compare results)
<hr></hr>
#### Beyond
* Gridsearch
* Overfitting


### Extras
#### Permutation importance vs Standard importance
- This might take way too long to do both, might just teach them permutation importance

#### Overfitting and combatting it
- training
- testing

#### Final exercise:
- Advanced: predicting using KNN and accuracy Titanic dataset
- Basic: predict and interpret different model for Corruption

#### KNN Example
Could use iris dataset. Maybe I'll run out of time to do this though.  Resource for this with a pretty graph https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC0J_SPm9co
